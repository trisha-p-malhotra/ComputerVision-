# ComputerVision-FacialExpressionClassification
Facial expression classifier

Problem statement:
Perform binary classification of facial expressions using a logistic regression classifier and a 2-layer neural network classifier. The main goal is to successfully write the predict and train functions for both classifiers. The dataset was obtained from 2013 Kaggle facial expression classification competition1. Although the original dataset contained 7 emotional classes, I will only use two of them (happy and sad).

Implements Logistic regression & Neural Network classifiers.
